# data-analysis
## Airbnb London EDA
In this project I aimed to do exploratory data analysis on the publicly available listings data available from Airbnb. I made use of Jupyter Notebook and Python packages including Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Numpy and Folium for data manipulation and visualisation.
## Stock Price vs Revenue
In this project I wanted to create a tool to compare company Stock Prices and Revenue using online data sources. I made use of the Yahoo Finance API to obtain stock data, Requests and BeautifulSoup Libraries for webscraping to obtain revenue data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Visualisation.
## Capstone Dashboard
This dashboard was the culmination of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate which I finished in January 2023. I used Cognos Analytics to create the dashboard.
